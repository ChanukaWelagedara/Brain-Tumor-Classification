# Brain Tumor Classification using Convolutional Neural Network

This project aims to classify brain tumors from MRI images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The dataset used is publicly available on Kaggle and includes four categories: glioma tumor, meningioma tumor, pituitary tumor, and no tumor.
## Introduction

Brain tumors are a critical health issue affecting both children and adults. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment planning. This project explores the application of CNNs to automate the classification of brain tumors based on MRI scans.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/ChanukaWelagedara/brain-tumor-classification.git
   cd brain-tumor-classification


2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle's "Brain Tumor Classification (MRI)" dataset. It includes a balanced distribution of MRI images across four categories:

- Glioma Tumor
- Meningioma Tumor
- Pituitary Tumor
- No Tumor
